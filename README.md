## Introduction

XMPPClient4j is a simple xmpp client based off of the [smack xmpp libraries](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/index.jsp "Smack XMPP").
Its aim is to create a simple, small and cross platform xmpp client that can be used by anyone. 

This is also a project that I am using to improve my own xmpp/network/java skills so if you have any suggestions feel free to send them.
As I have stated later in this document, I will implement suggestions once all of the core functions have been added.


## Status

The project is getting a complete overhaul of what I have previously done. As of today the project is empty until I have substantial code to commit. 

I will add any suggested features once I have completed the core basics.

## Dependencies

*    To build the project you will need the following:

  *    Smack XMPP [libraries](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/index.jsp "Smack XMPP")
  *    Java [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html "JDK 7") make sure to download the correct depending on your system.
  *    An IDE of your choice. Unless building projects in command line is your thing... I would personally recommend [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ "IntelliJ IDEA") or [Netbeans 8](https://netbeans.org/downloads/ "Netbeans 8") which has an optional bundled JDK.

This client should be cross platform. I will be testing in Ubuntu (latest build) as well as Windows 7 and 8.1 once I have completed the core basics which will be built in Windows 7 and 8.1.
If you experience any problems or crashes on other systems please let me know.


## Building

To build this project import it into Netbeans/Intellij/Eclipse or similar and build it through there as you would any other java project. Make sure you have all of the dependecies. 

If you need help please leave a comment or refer to Google.

## License

This project currently has no license. As it progresses and I have added more defining features I will add a license that fits the project best.

For now you may distribute/share/break/make fun of and/or ignore this project. Do with it as you want until further notice.
